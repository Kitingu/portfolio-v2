Hey, Benedict Kiting'u here. This post is just an introduction about myself.
I'm currently a software developer at syscraft limited. I have started my personal blog to write about my experience while coding. I'm very passionate about web development and have recently started learning Desktop development in Java. I will mainly be writing about things that I encounter during working on some fun projects.

Check out my [portfolio](https://kitingu.com/) made using Gatsby.js. Also, this blog is made using Gatsby.js you can grab the template at [Github](https://github.com/kitingu/portfolio-v2)
